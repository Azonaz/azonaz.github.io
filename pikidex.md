# Pikidex

This is a small, fan-built application. It allows you to track the progress of pikimin collection in Pikmin Bloom game.

All progress is saved only on your device.

[Download in App Store](https://apps.apple.com/cy/app/pikidex/id1607358713).

### How to use application
Tap on the icon, it will change its state:

- none,
- in progress (got pikmin and levelling friendship),
- done (got four hearts of friendship).

### Tips and tricks

1. Tap on group header (for example, Restaurant) to make it compact.

2. Double tap group header to collapse all groups. This will switch all your collection to the compact mode.
3. In compact mode: tap on the icon of the group (first in a row) to expand this group.
