This is a small casual game. The main goal is to break a brick by hitting it with the hero's head.

To hit, tap anywhere on the screen.

Each third wall features a leaderboard where fewer hits are better. The leaderboards reset every four weeks.

# Pikidex

This is a small, fan-built application. It allows you to track and share the progress of pikimin collection in Pikmin Bloom game.

All progress is saved only on your device.

[Download in App Store](https://apps.apple.com/cy/app/pikidex/id1607358713).

### How to use application
Tap on the icon, it will change its state:

- none,
- in progress (got pikmin and levelling friendship),
- done (got four hearts of friendship).

### Tips and tricks

1. Tap on group header (for example, Restaurant) to make it compact.

### Known issues
**2.0.0**

When you buy a subscription, sometimes hiding currently unavailable decor is not working. Workaround: restart the app.

- the number of pikmin with each color and/or decor,
- new icons,
- translations.
