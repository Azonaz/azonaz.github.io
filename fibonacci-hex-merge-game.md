# Fibonacci Hex Merge

![fibonacci-hex-merge-preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/effe9fdb-433f-40f3-acc7-bc33f4f50925)


This is a tiny minimalistic puzzle with simple rules: drag numbers to merge them into bigger number from the Fibonacci sequence. 
1 & 2 merge into 3, 2 & 3 — into 5 and so on.


## How to Play

1. Drag Numbers: Place number on the hex grid.
2. Merge: Combine numbers to create the next in the Fibonacci sequence (e.g., 1+2=3, 2+3=5).
3. Score: Earn points for every merge. Extra merges on the last number = more bonus points!
4. Plan Ahead: Place numbers strategically for higher scores and combos.

## Useful tips

1. All numbers available: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89.
2. After placing a hex on the field, the merge order is this:
